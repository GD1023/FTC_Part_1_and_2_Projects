## This is my voice memo transcript:

### Hey this is my voice memo for the FTC project so today all I did was just understand the idea of the converse Game of Life 
and the rules even better I watch some YouTube videos to try understanding like it's a bit more about how I like the simulation 
works and after that I am going to spend more time trying to understand how exactly the simulation can be translated into code
 specifically using python.



NOTES:
Alive<2 : Die
Alive>3: Die
Alive =2=3: alive
Dead = 3: Alive

Okay so this is my day too voice memo transcript for April 13th 2025 and basically I today I just spent more time trying to understand 
what it's like the best method for me to complete the part one project or the seller automata I'm conveys Game of Life and basically what
 I'm planning on doing is creating a list there's going to be 80 lists with 80 attributes within the list and they're all going to be originally 
 zero because that's what one of the Criterion was for the code that everything starts off dead and every single time the user interacts with the
  code and it changes like the status of the specific cell what I'm going to do is right I'm going to divide that by the total number of rows and 
  columns to find the exact location and update my grid basically the grid that's made through the list remember that I told you it's going to be 
  80 lists with 80 attributes zre going to be updated  with either one or zero and then a once the space bars clicked to initiate the actual processing
   time what will happen is that the code will check to like all the requirements for example if there if it's alive but less than two neighbors
    that are alive it dies and so on and based on that they'll be like freak on frequent updates on the screen but in reality what's really happening 
    is that there's going to be two grids one is the original grid which contains all the zeros at one time and a second grade which is being updated so that's what the idea is

So today I just spend more time coding my plan for the  for the  Conway's Game of Life and basically what I did in my code is I first I am first acquitted a grid like the 80x80 grid I mean right now I 
just made it 80 by 84 testing purposes and then I created two functions one named update screen basically this update screen function occurs after like the user interacts with the screen like and mix it
alive and dead and then the process starts and the second function I created was neighbors some the neighbors some ideally what it does is it just checks all eight neighbors the specific cell and basically
it just like gives you the sum of all the neighbors that are alive and the reason why this function is like not too hard to make is because either zero or one one being alive right so all you're doing is
just summing it up and if the sum is just going to be like basically how many they're alive cells there are because they have the value of one after that I have a wall true Loop going on which just means kind 
of like continuously go on and the first thing it does is it like listens to the specific events within the screen so for example if the user quits the game the pie game screen is quit and the system just exits and 
it also like checks for inputs for the mouse so if like the let's say the left click right then the specific coordinates of that click are jotted down and the specific coordinates are used  and they are divided by
the cell size to find the specific location of the column Monroe where they're located and based off of that we input those in third grade and change that value to one and the same process goes on with High game 
that mouse that get pressed with two this time because the two stands for the right click and instead of the value being changed to one it's being changed to zero and also the since I want to make my code scalable
for the right click what happens is you just changing the value of the grid to be equal one but when you right click to delete the specific live cell what I did was I just made that I'm so black automatically because 
the problem is when I'm using pie game and and I'm iterating through all 64,000 cells it's next to impossible for there to be efficiency with my code so instead of me looking at all 64,000 cells I'm just looking at 
the alive cells and with those alive cells I'm checking the neighbors and based off of that I'm either turning that specific cell alive or dead and this continues on for every single life so so instead of me having to 
color individually everything else is just like automatically black and then like black and says that it's dead and then it's just checking on the grid whether any values are one and if the values are one then it's turned to White. 
also I'm going to have to take a bit of a break from these projects because I have and because I have my final tests this week so I got through part one as of now and I'm looking forward to completing part 2  
during the spring break after I come back from my vacation.
